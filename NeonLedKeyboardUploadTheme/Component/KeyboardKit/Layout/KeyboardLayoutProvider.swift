/**
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can return
 keyboard layouts for keyboard contexts.
 
 KeyboardKit will create a ``StandardKeyboardLayoutProvider``
 instance when the keyboard extension is started, then apply
 it to ``KeyboardInputViewController/keyboardLayoutProvider``.
 The instance is then used by default to create layouts that
 can be used in e.g. a ``SystemKeyboard``.
 
 To change the layouts that are used for different keyboards,
 you can implement a custom provider.
 
 To create a custom implementation of this protocol, you can
 implement it from scratch or inherit the standard class and
 override the parts that you want to change. When the custom
 implementation is done, you can just replace the controller
 service to make KeyboardKit use the custom service globally.
 
 KeyboardKit Pro unlock localized providers for all locales.
