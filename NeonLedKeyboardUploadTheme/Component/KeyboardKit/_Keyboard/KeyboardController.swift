/**
 This protocol is used to make using the keyboard input view
 controller more abstract and available to more platforms.

 ``KeyboardInputViewController`` implements this protocol by
 calling itself, its document proxy, or its keyboard context.

 The protocol currently defines what's currently required to
 trigger controller-specific actions within the library, but
 it may add functionality over time. Note that this protocol
 should only specify operations and not state.
