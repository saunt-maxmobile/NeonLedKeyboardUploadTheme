/**
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can return
 autocomplete suggestions as the user types.

 Simply call ``autocompleteSuggestions(for:)`` to perform an
 autocomplete operation that returns suggestions for a text.

 KeyboardKit doesn't have a standard provider as it does for
 other services. Instead, an ``Autocomplete/DisabledProvider``
 will be used until you register a real one.
 
 KeyboardKit Pro will unlock two providers when you register
 a valid license key. LocalAutocompleteProvider runs locally
 on device, while RemoteAutocompleteProvider can communicate
 with remote, REST-based APIs.
