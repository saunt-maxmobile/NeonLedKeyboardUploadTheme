     Apply keyboard button gestures to the view, that should

     - Parameters:
       - action: The keyboard action to trigger.
       - actionHandler: The keyboard action handler to use.
       - calloutContext: The callout context to affect, if any.
       - isPressed: An optional binding that can be used to observe the button pressed state.
       - isInScrollView: Whether or not the gestures are used in a scroll view, by default `false`.
       - releaseOutsideTolerance: The percentage of the button size that should span outside the button bounds and still count as a release, by default `0.75`.
