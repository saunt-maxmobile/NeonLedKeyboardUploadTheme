/**
 This class can be used to observe the state of any keyboard.

 This lets us check if a keyboard has been enabled in System
 Settings, if Full Access is granted, and if it's being used.

 This type supports bundle id wildcards, which means that it
 can be used to inspect multiple keyboards, with a single id:

 ```
 @StateObject
 var state = KeyboardStateContext(bundleId: "com.myapp.*")
 ```

 The context is not added to the input controller, since the
 keyboard state is intended to be used in the main app.

     the main application.

       - bundleId: The bundle ID of the keyboard extension.
       - notificationCenter: The notification center to use to observe changes.
