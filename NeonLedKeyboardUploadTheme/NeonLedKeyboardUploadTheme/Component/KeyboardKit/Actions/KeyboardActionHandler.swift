/**
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can handle
 ``KeyboardAction`` gestures and events.
 
 KeyboardKit will create a ``StandardKeyboardActionHandler``
 instance when the keyboard extension is started, then apply
 it to ``KeyboardInputViewController/keyboardActionHandler``.
 This instance is then used by default to determine how your
 keyboard extension handles actions.
 
 Many actions have standard behaviors while others don't and
 therefore require a custom action handler to have an effect.
 To change how your keyboard handles actions, you can create
 a custom keyboard action handler.
 
 To create a custom implementation of this protocol, you can
 implement it from scratch or inherit the standard class and
 override the parts that you want to change. When the custom
 implementation is done, you can just replace the controller
 service to make KeyboardKit use the custom service globally.
