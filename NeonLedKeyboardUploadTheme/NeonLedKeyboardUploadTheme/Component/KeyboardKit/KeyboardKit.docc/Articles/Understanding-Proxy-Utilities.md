# Understanding Proxy Utilities

This article describes the KeyboardKit proxy engine.

iOS keyboard extensions use the native **UITextDocumentProxy** to integrate with the currently active application. It lets you insert and delete text, get the selected text, move the input cursor, etc.

The native proxy APIs are however quite limited, which makes it hard to get detailed information and perform many standard keyboard operations. For instance, you have to manually write code to get the current word, understand where the cursor is, etc.

KeyboardKit adds a bunch of **UITextDocumentProxy** extension to make things easier. ``KeyboardInputViewController`` also has a custom ``KeyboardInputViewController/textDocumentProxy`` property that lets you do more than with the native proxy. 

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] adds even more proxy capabilities, such as the ability to read the full document context. Information about Pro features can be found at the end of this article. 



## Proxy namespace

KeyboardKit has a ``Proxy`` namespace that contains proxy-related types.

For now, this namespace will only contain types when it's part of the KeyboardKit Pro build.

The namespace doesn't contain protocols, open classes, or types that are meant to be exposed at the top-level.



## Extensions

Since **UITextDocumentProxy** extensions are not included in the generated documentation, here is a list of extensions that you get access to by simply importing KeyboardKit into your project:


### Autocomplete

- hasAutocompleteInsertedSpace
- hasAutocompleteRemovedSpace
- insertAutocompleteSuggestion(_:tryInsertSpace:)
- tryInsertSpaceAfterAutocomplete()
- tryReinsertAutocompleteRemovedSpace()
- tryRemoveAutocompleteInsertedSpace

### Content

- documentContext  
- isReadingFullDocumentContext

### Delete

- deleteBackward(range:)
- deleteBackward(times:)

### Quotation

- hasUnclosedQuotationBeforeInput(for:)
- hasUnclosedAlternateQuotationBeforeInput(for:)
- preferredQuotationReplacement(whenInserting:for:)

### Sentences

- isCursorAtNewSentence
- isCursorAtNewSentenceWithTrailingWhitespace
- sentenceBeforeInput
- sentenceDelimiters
- endSentence()

### Words

- currentWord
- currentWordPreCursorPart
- currentWordPostCursorPart
- hasCurrentWord
- isCursorAtNewWord
- isCursorAtTheEndOfTheCurrentWord
- wordBeforeInput
- replaceCurrentWord(with replacement: String)



## ðŸ‘‘ Pro features

[KeyboardKit Pro][Pro] unlocks additional text document proxy capabilities, such as the ability to read the full document content instead of the limited text amount you get access to by default.


### How to read the full document context

As you may have noticed, the `UITextDocumentProxy`'s  **documentContextBeforeInput** and **documentContextAfterInput** don't return *all* text before and after the input cursor. Any new paragraph may at any time stop the proxy from reading more content.

This makes it hard to perform more complex operations, such as proof-reading a document, provide AI-based functionality, etc.

KeyboardKit Pro therefore unlocks additional proxy extensions that let you read all text from the text document proxy. Just use the `fullDocumentContext` alternatives instead of `documentContext` to read all the available text:

```swift
struct KeyboardView: View {

    @EnvironmentObject
    private var context: KeyboardContext

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button("Get the full document context") {
                Task {
                    let proxy = context.textDocumentProxy
                    let result = try? await proxy.fullDocumentContext()
                    await MainActor.run {
                        print(result?.fullDocumentContext)
                        print(result?.fullDocumentContextBeforeInput)
                        print(result?.fullDocumentContextAfterInput)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

These functions read the full document by moving the input cursor to get access to more text. It's not a fail-safe operation, but has been tweaked to provide as accurate results as possible to as many device types as possible.

If you need to configure the read operation, you can pass in a custom **Proxy.FullDocumentConfiguration** that lets you tweak factors like sleep time and how many times to try to read more content at the detected end.

Since the full document context functions are `async`, you need to wrap them in a task when calling them from SwiftUI, for instance.
