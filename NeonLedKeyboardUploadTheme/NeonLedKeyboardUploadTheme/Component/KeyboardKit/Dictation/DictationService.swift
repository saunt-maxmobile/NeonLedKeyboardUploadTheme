/**
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that can handle
 dictation, e.g. by using the device microphone.

 This service doesn't work in keyboard extensions, since the
 extension layer can't access the microphone. Keyboards must
 instead use a ``KeyboardDictationService`` for dictation.

 To start dictation, ``startDictation(with:)`` should set up
 the audio engine and perform dictation. Since dictation may
 stop at any time, e.g. by silence, a service implementation
 must describe how you can access the dictation result. Call
 ``stopDictation()`` to stop dictation.

 Services should call ``requestDictationAuthorization()`` to
 request the required permissions before stating a dictation.
 
 KeyboardKit doesn't have a standard service, as it does for
 other services. You must either implement a service, or use
 KeyboardKit Pro, which will automatically unlock a standard
 dictation service when a Gold license key is registered.
